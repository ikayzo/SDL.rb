[x] Is Base64 really compatible with the format defined in the Java version ?
    ==> Seems so after having implemented more of the standard tests.
[ ] Add more unit tests
    [x] Attribute tests
    [x] Date tests
    [x] Date + time test
    [x] Time zone tests
    [x] Number literal tests
    [x] Strings literals (especially with line continuations)
    [x] Sub tags tests
    [x] "null" value test
    [x] Comment tests
    [ ] Bad syntax tests
[ ] Test write (unit tests)
    [ ] Dates
    [ ] Numbers
[A] Use YARD in order to generate documentation ?
    ==> alternatively, I tried to generate some RDoc templates but none worked in Rake...
[ ] BUG: the line number is too high by 1 (the column is correct).
[/] Fix the differences between test_basic_types.sdl and what is generated from the parsed structure
    [x] chars
    [x] longs
    [x] doubles
    [x] decimals
    [x] booleans
    [x] null
    [x] dates
    [x] times
        [x] negative times
    [x] datetimes
        [/] zone codes
        ==> Time only works in UTC, which means that the original zone code is lost.
        ==> DateTime doesn't give the zone code but only the offset.
        [ ] Use TzTime? Use a custom object that knows whether a time zone was specified?
            ==> http://tztime.rubyforge.org/
            ==> along with TzInfo: http://tzinfo.rubyforge.org/
[ ] See how Ruby floats relate to Java floats and doubles.
[ ] Add tests for the SDL class
[ ] Allow unicode characters in identifiers.
[ ] FUTURE: It might be useful to allow people to replace the standard types by their own. This
    could be useful for dates or numbers, for instance.
[N] To install a gem in the Netbeans gems repository, it needs to run as an administrator.
    Otherwise, it fails silently.
[ ] FUTURE: Consider being able to read text files that are not UTF-8(?)
[ ] BUG: the report on the line no in errors is off by 1 (at least in some cases)
[x] Return copies or original arrays in Tag?
    ==> we return the implementation Arrays or Hashes (or whatever) for efficiency.
        However, we ask the users not to assume anything as we might protect the returned objects in
        the future.
[ ] Tag.hash: the implementation is not very efficient.
    ==> Difficult to make better and still simple
    ==> Maybe possible when it's frozen.
[ ] FUTURE: xpath, ypath ==> sdlpath(?)
[ ] FUTURE: evenemential parsing(?)
[ ] FUTURE: add a way to insert a tag after or before another(?)
[ ] FUTURE: allow some way of generating YAML(?)
[ ] FUTURE: allow to turn a YAML structure into a SDL one(?)
[ ] BUG: "rake package" tries to archive the contents twice: once with the command that I configure
    in Rakefile, once with a zip command that can't work on my machine (zip is not installed). Why?
    At least, the first archive is created and seems correct.
[ ] FUTURE: Would we need a "write" method in SDL4R?
[x] Add tests and release a RC or beta version
[x] Make the methods of Tag that take a block have a better yield doc/completion
    ==> I added :yields: RDoc directives, which doesn't look like it's helping but I guess that's
        all I can do for now.
[N] Never call a class "Test" => it can easily conflict with the "Test" module of Test::Unit and
    then, it becomes quite difficult to understand why.
[ ] Input relevant URLs on http://rubygems.org
[x] What prevents from doing the following?
    tag.values << IO.new("toto.txt")
    ==> It doesn't break the behavior as long as the value type is OK. Even if it is not allowed,
        it still is not too bad.
[x] Look at the returned values of method who do not have their return values documented e.g.
    Tag.add_value
    ==> Minor change: we return nil for the methods were nothing was really returned explicitely
        (for the time being).
[x] If there is any success, maybe create/recreate the Rubyforge site for the support.
[ ] Should we allow to create a Tag without a name (== "content") for anonymous Tags?
[x] It would be cool to be able to write this:

    Tag.new "toto" do |tag|
        tag << 123
    end

    ==> We can detect whether there is an argument or not.

Note that instance_eval() doesn't allow to pass parameters right now.
[ ] Add latest doc access to RubyForge:
    ==> Rake task?

[x] Is it right to translate the SDL
        attr1=null
    into the XML
        attr1="null"
    ?
    Should we remove the attribute altogether? Check the Java version => same in Java
    ==> Maybe provide an options Hash in to_xml_string():
            :uri_by_namespace => {...} (breaks the old interface)
            :hide_null_attributes => true|false
[x] Where we accept Arrays (operator <<, for instance), let's accept Enumerable or something like
	that.
[ ] Implement the [] operator in order to access attributes:
    ["attr"] <=> attribute("attr")
    ["ns:attr"] <=> attribute("ns", "attr") (should we allow this?)
    ["ns", "attr"] <=> attribute("ns", "attr")
    Should we allow attribute("ns:attr")?
[ ] IDEA: marshaller? easy object <=> SDL read/write?
[ ] Check the coverage and make the tests better.
[ ] IDEA: add an option to the XML export allowing to write anonymous nodes as XML tag content?
[ ] IDEA: add an option to the XML export allowing to export without formatting?
[x] BUG: line continuation is not handled properly (skipping chars etc).
[ ] BUG: the rake task 'gen_rubyforge' doesn't work under 1.9 (only 1.8.7)
