== v0.9.8 (建設中)

== v0.9.7 (26-auf-2010)

=== Major changes:

* It could prove a hassle to use the block idiom of Tag.new or Tag.new_child when handling another
  set of data. Therefore, if the given block takes a (not-optional) parameter, the context remains
  the context of the calling code.

    class Elephant

      def initialize
         @weight = 1000
      end

      def to_sdl
        SDL4R::Tag.new("elephant") do |tag|
          tag.set_attribute("weight", @weight)
          tag << "I love pink ones."
        end
      end

    end

    puts Elephant.new.to_sdl.to_s # ==> elephant "I love pink ones." weight=1000

* Tag.to_xml_string() has been refactor to take an option Hash (backward incompatible):

  [:line_prefix] a text prefixing each line (default: "")
  [:uri_by_namespace] a Hash giving the URIs for the namespaces
  [:indent] text specifying one indentation (default: "\t")
  [:eol] end of line expression (default: "\n")
  [:omit_null_attributes]
    if true, null/nil attributes are not exported (default: false). Otherwise, they are exported
    as follows:
      tag attr="null"

* Fixed the parsing of line continuations with anti-slashes.
* Fixed the parsing of double-quoted strings. It is better at detecting badly formed strings, now.
* Fixed the reporting of lines and columns in errors.
  Although the column might be slightly off sometimes, the line should be correct.


=== Minor changes:

* The RDoc is now generated with the template Hanna[http://github.com/mislav/hanna/tree/master].
* Tag.<< now behaves with Enumerables (except Strings) as it does with Arrays.

== v0.9.6 (10-aug-2010)

=== Major changes:

* Tag.set_attribute(): fixed as it failed if the value was nil.
* Tag.write(): now returns the given output (especially necessary if a String was given).
* Tag.write(): fixed as it failed when writing children without including the root Tag.
* Tag.write(): it is now possible to give a StringIO as an output

== v0.9.5 (8-aug-2010)

=== Major changes:

* Fixes in order to make SDL4R work in Ruby 1.9 (mainly concerning encodings and dates).
* Commented out debug code (writing to files) inside sdl4r_test.rb.

=== Minor changes:

* General & contact info in the README

== v0.9.4 (6-aug-2010)

=== Major changes:

* The use of BigDecimal (standard) has been preferred to Flt::DecNum.
* "sdl4r/sdl.rb" has been renamed to "sdl4r/sdl4r.rb"
* A sdl4r.rb has been added so that users can actually write (as the documentation pretended):

    require 'sdl4r'

* SDL4R#coerce_or_fail has been implemented, which means that random objects cannot be added to a
  Tag as before. Rational instances are coerced using Rational#to_f.
* Added usual time methods to SdlTimeSpan: day(), hour(), min(), sec(), usec()

== v0.9.3

=== Major changes

* Tag: any method that use to take namespace/name parameters now follows the natural order
  "namespace" and then "name":

    Tag.new "ns1", "tag1"

  WARNING: this was the contrary before!!!
  Also, the "recursive" parameter should always be at the first place now.

* It is now possible to override SDL4R::new_date_time in order to create Time instances when parsing
  rather than DateTime instances.
